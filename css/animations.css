/*
 * animations.css - Honoka's Blog
 * This file is now cleared to prevent potential CSS conflicts and redundant imports.
 *
 * If you have custom CSS @keyframes rules (e.g., for entrance animations, special effects),
 * you should add them DIRECTLY to the 'css/style.css' file at its end,
 * or manage them carefully if you absolutely require a separate file.
 *
 * All core animations (fade-out cursor trail, spin, pulse, pulse-glow, homepage-title-flow-gradient, header-text-pulse-glow
 * and hamburger menu animations) are now defined within `style.css` for consolidation and clarity.
